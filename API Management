# Overview of the Canvas API
# REST API:

# The Canvas API is primarily RESTful, using standard HTTP methods and JSON for request and response bodies.
# The base URL for the API is usually https://<canvas_instance>/api/v1/, where <canvas_instance> is your institution's Canvas domain.

# Authentication:

# Authentication is typically done via OAuth2 or API tokens.
# API tokens can be generated in the Canvas LMS under the user's account settings.
# Endpoints:

# Courses: Retrieve and manage course information.
# Assignments: Create, update, and delete assignments.
# Users: Manage user accounts and profiles.
# Enrollments: Handle enrollments in courses.
# Grades: Access and update grades.
# Modules: Manage course modules and their content.
# Files: Upload and manage files within courses.

import requests

# Replace with your Canvas instance URL and API token
canvas_base_url = 'https://<canvas_instance>/api/v1'
api_token = 'your_api_token_here'

# Set up the request headers
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_token}'
}

# Endpoint to get the current user's courses
endpoint = f'{canvas_base_url}/courses'

# Make the request
response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    courses = response.json()
    for course in courses:
        print(f"Course ID: {course['id']}, Name: {course['name']}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve courses: {response.status_code}")
